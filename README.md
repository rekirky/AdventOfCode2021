# Advent of Code 2021 - Kirky
Storage location for Advent of Code 2021 repo  [https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

Coding challenge akin to an advent calendar. Each day a new challenge is released. 
They can be solved in any order but follow a story when worked through chronologicially. 
Solutions can be reached using any methods, code languages and processes are up to each participant.

I will be primarily focussing on Python this year but will attempt other languages to test learnings throughout the year
